# 2022

## How to run
You'll need `go` installed on Ubuntu. Should also work on other OS's but it is only tested on Ubuntu ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
To run, go to `2022/` and run `go run main.go --day=13` for example. To run it from elsewhere you'll
need to set evironment variable `AOC_2022_ROOT` to the 2022 dir:
```bash
/path/to/repo/2022$ go run main.go --day=13
```

## Running tests
Go to `2022/` and either run `go test ./...` directly, or do so with coverage included:
```bash
/path/to/repo/2022$ bash coverage.sh
```
