# Readme

This repository contains my solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code challenge.
The idea is to use C to solve the problems, at least until I grow tired of it and switch to Python.

# To use
Build with `bash build.sh`.

Run with `bash run.sh xx` where `xx` is the day (padded with zeros, eg: 01, 07, 19, 23).

To change the data you may modify file `data/xx/data.txt` where `xx` is the zero-padded day. Some solutions assume that there is a single newline at the end of the file, so ensure it is there.
